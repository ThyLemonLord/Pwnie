Put the speedBoost.cpp and libGameLogic.h files into the ./Inputs/Source/ directory

Then call the bundlehax.sh from the root of this section

Now you should have pwnhax.sh in the ./Outputs directory

Simply copy this to the same directory that pwnie islands binary is in



To use the script:
	Within the terminal, enter the directory that pwnie islands binary is in
	Run "./pwnhax.sh compile" to compile the library, a .so file will appear in the directory
	Then Run "./pwnhax.sh" whenenver you want the game to run with that library preloaded, Happy Hacking :)
